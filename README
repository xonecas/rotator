 * Description: script that reads all the files in a directory and
 * sets them as a random wallpaper. If you intend to use this, please
 * make sure you only have IMAGE files in the specified directory.
 * once the script is started you can set the walpaper to the rotator.png
 * that was just created in the pictures folder
 *
 * USAGE: node rotator.js ['/path/to/pictures_folder'] [interval=30]
 *
 * The path is relative to the root (/).
 * If you don't supply a folder, it will look for:
 *    cwd + '/Pictures' (default)
 * If you don't supply an interval it will default to 30 min

this needs to be updated.
